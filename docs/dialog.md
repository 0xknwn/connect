## opening

a very simple protocol
- dapp propose fo the signer to sign
- signer enter key (e.g. OTP or QR Code) to agree with the dapp
- dapp send a secret that only she can know (e.g. a 4-digit code that has been
  tansmitted by another way, e.g. Voice, Phone or Email) that we consider safe
  enough for KYC

## maintaining

- Channels should not be maintained, i.e. limited in time
- Source and Destination should be identified with private/public keys signatures
- Message might not be intercepted by others, i.e. ciphered

## interacting

- notifications
- discoveable
- noise
